Hi! I'm Wayne (she/her) and I am an incoming Geology Master's student at the University of Kansas. I will be joining the [HEAL@KGS](https://www.samzipper.com/) lab where I will be working on hydrology work with Dr. Sam Zipper.

#### My Projects:
- [easyrbi](https://github.com/amutaya/easyrbi): an R ðŸ“¦ for retrieving streamflow data from the USGS[](https://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/Site-Test-Tool.html) website and calculating the Richards-Baker Flashiness Index (RBI) trends. 
- [moderndive/ModernDive_book](https://github.com/moderndive/ModernDive_book): an open source textbook for introductory data science and statistics.
